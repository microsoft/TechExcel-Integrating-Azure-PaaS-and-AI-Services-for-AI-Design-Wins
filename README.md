I'll help you create a comprehensive statistical analysis framework in Python. Here's the implementation:

```python project="Statistical Analysis" file="data_analysis.py"
...
```

This implementation provides:

1. **Statistical Analysis**:

1. Basic statistics (mean, median, std dev)
2. Confidence intervals
3. Distribution analysis
4. Hypothesis testing



2. **Data Visualization**:

1. Distribution plots
2. Box plots for group comparisons
3. Saved as PNG files



3. **Results Storage**:

1. JSON files for numerical results
2. PNG files for visualizations
3. Organized in an 'analysis_results' directory



4. **Best Practices**:

1. Type hints
2. Error handling
3. Documentation
4. Clean code structure





To use this code:

```python
# With your own data
analyzer = DataAnalyzer('your_data.csv')
analyzer.load_data()
analyzer.create_summary_report('column_name', 'group_column')

# Or with sample data
analyzer = DataAnalyzer()
analyzer.load_data()  # Generates sample data
analyzer.create_summary_report('values', 'group')
```

The code will create an 'analysis_results' directory containing:

- statistics.json
- distribution.png
- group_comparison.png
- full_report.json


This provides a solid foundation for statistical analysis while demonstrating proper Python practices and library usage.
