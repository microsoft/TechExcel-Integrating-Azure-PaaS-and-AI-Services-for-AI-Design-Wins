# Task 02 - Create and store vector embeddings (45 minutes)

## Introduction

Vectors, also known as embeddings or vector embeddings, are mathematical representations of data in a high-dimensional space. Each dimension corresponds to a feature of the data in this space, and tens of thousands of dimensions might be used to represent sophisticated data. A vector's position in this space represents its characteristics. Words, phrases, or entire documents, as well as images, audio, and other types of data, can all be vectorized. An embedding is a data representation format that machine learning models and algorithms can efficiently utilize. The embedding is an information-dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating point numbers. Hence, the distance between two embeddings in the vector space correlates with the semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. Azure OpenAI provides several models for creating vector embeddings, and for this exercise, you will use the `text-embedding-ada-002` model.

You will use a vector database to store the generated embeddings. Vector databases are designed to store and manage vector embeddings. The vector database you will use is Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. It allows you to store vectors alongside traditional schema-free data within your documents, streamlining data management and significantly enhancing the efficiency of vector operations. Keeping all relevant data in a single logical unit simplifies your data architecture, making it easy to understand and manage.

## Description

You configured Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL as an integrated vector database in the prior task. In this task, you will use an Azure Function, Azure OpenAI, and the Azure Cosmos DB change feed to generate vector embeddings for property maintenance requests and save those into the `MaintenanceRequests` container in Cosmos DB.

You will conclude by uploading data supplied by the Contoso Suites staff into the `MaintenanceRequests` container you created in Cosmos DB and allowing the deployed function app to generate vectors for each record. The JSON data files provided by Contoso Suites contain maintenance requests for several hotels on their resorts. They offer an example of the types of data the company believes can benefit from the similarity search capabilities provided by Vector Search in Cosmos DB for NoSQL, so they would like you to incorporate this data into the proof of concept.

## Success Criteria

- You have tested the function locally.
- You have deployed the function to your Azure Function app.
- You have successfully created vector embeddings for each document in the `PropertyMaintenance.json` file using the deployed Function App and written them into Azure Cosmos DB.
- You have executed a `VectorDistance()` function via the Cosmos DB Data Explorer.

## Tips

1. You may get the following error when trying to deploy the Azure Function:

    ![An error message that no project root could be found.](../../media/Solution/0302-azure-function-no-root.png)

    If you get this error message, you must set the default Azure Functions project in the workspace folder. Close and re-open Visual Studio Code, and you should see a warning message that you have multiple function projects in the same workspace folder.

    ![A warning message that there exist multiple function projects in the same workspace folder.](../../media/Solution/0302-azure-function-set-default.png)

    After selecting the **Set Default** button, you will receive a prompt to choose a default project subpath. Choose the `src\ContosoSuites\VectorizationFunction` option.

    ![Choose the VectorizationFunction folder as the default project subpath.](../../media/Solution/0302-azure-function-set-default-2.png)

    You may receive a warning message asking if you wish to initialize this function for optimal use with Visual Studio Code. Select **Yes** to do this.

    ![Initialize the project for optimal use with Visual Studio Code.](../../media/Solution/0302-azure-function-initialize.png)

    You will receive a warning modal that this operation will overwrite your task.json. Select **Overwrite** to complete this task.

    ![Overwrite the func: host start task in your tasks.json file.](../../media/Solution/0302-azure-function-overwrite.png)

2. If you receive authentication errors for Cosmos DB when running the Azure Function locally, it may be that internal policies have disabled key-based authentication. To fix this:

    Navigate to the `src\InfrastructureAsCode` folder to Visual Studio Code and right-click the `DeployAzureResources.bicep` file. Then, select **Deploy Bicep File...** in the context menu. This will update your Azure Cosmos DB instance to re-enable key-based authentication.

    {: .note }
    > The update may take up to 10 minutes before you see the change apply.

## Key Tasks

### 01: Review Azure function code

Review the Azure Function code in the `CosmosChangeFeedVectorization.cs` file in the `src\ContosoSuitesVectorizationFunction` folder. The function:

1. Is triggered whenever a document is inserted or updated in the `MaintenanceRequests` container using the Azure Cosmos DB change feed.
2. Combines the contents of a maintenance request's `hotel` and `details` fields and vectorizes the resulting text using a `text-embedding-ada-002` model in Azure OpenAI.
3. Writes generated vectors into the `request_embeddings` fields of the document and updates it in the `MaintenanceRequests` container.
4. Marks the document as "Vectorized."

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary>

The steps to review the function app are as follows:

1. Open the `CosmosChangeFeedVectorization.cs` file in the `src\ContosoSuitesVectorizationFunction` folder.
2. The `DatabaseName` and `ContainerName` constants defined on lines 16 and 17 refer to the Azure Cosmos DB database created by the Bicep script and the container you created in task 1 of this exercise, respectively. If those values differ in your environment, the values assigned to the constants must be updated to reflect what is in your environment.
3. Locate the `Run` function starting on line 42 and examine the code contained within it.
   1. The code on line 49 reduces the list of documents sent to the function to only those that do not have a `Type` of "Vectorized". This prevents the updates pushed by the function back to the `MaintenanceRequests` container from being revectorized by the function.
   2. If no documents require vectorization, the function will exit without making any changes to the input documents.
   3. The `foreach` loop starting on line 52 iterates through each document in the change feed that requires vectorization. The `hotel` and `details` fields are combined, and the text is sent to Azure OpenAI to create vector embeddings using the deployment for the `text-embedding-ada-002` model. The returned vector embeddings are saved into the `RequestVector` field of the document.
   4. The document's `Type` field is "Vectorized."
   5. On line 74, the list of input documents is returned, which uses the Cosmos DB output binding to write the documents updated with vector embeddings back into the `MaintenanceRequests` container in Cosmos DB.

</details>

### 02: Create settings file

Create a `local.settings.json` file in the `src\ContosoSuitesVectorizationFunction` folder and populate it with the settings the function needs to run the function locally. Hint: the required values can be identified using the calls to `Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable` in the `CosmosChangeFeedVectorization.cs` file, as well as providing the Cosmos DB connection string required by the input and output bindings of the function.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary>

To create a `local.settings.json` file, navigate to the `src\ContosoSuitesVectorizationFunction` directory, create a new file named `local.settings.json`, and add the following content, replacing the bracketed tokens with values from your Azure OpenAI and Azure Cosmos DB services.

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet-isolated",
    "AzureOpenAIEndpoint": "[YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT]",
    "AzureOpenAIKey": "[YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_KEY]",
    "CosmosDBConnectionString": "[YOUR_COSMOS_DB_CONNECTION_STRING]",
    "EmbeddingDeploymentName": "text-embedding-ada-002"
  }
}
```

To retrieve the required Azure OpenAI and Cosmos DB values:

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) in a web browser and navigate to the resource group you created.
2. Select the Azure OpenAI service in the resource group.
   1. Under the **Resource Management** menu, select **Keys and Endpoint**.
   2. Copy the value of **KEY 1** and paste it into the `AzureOpenAIKey` value of the `local.settings.json` file.
   3. Copy the value of **Endpoint** and paste it into the `AzureOpenAIEndpoint` value.

    ![The Azure OpenAI Keys and Endpoint page is displayed, with the copy buttons for KEY 1 and Endpoint highlighted.](../../media/Solution/0302-azure-openai-keys-and-endpoint.png)

3. Return to your resource group and select the Azure Cosmos DB resource.
   1. Under the **Settings** menu, select **Keys**, then show and copy the **PRIMARY CONNECTION STRING** value and paste it as the `CosmosDBConnectionString` value in the `local.settings.json` file.

   ![The Azure Cosmos DB account Keys page is displayed, with the PRIMARY CONNECTION STRING copy button highlighted.](../../media/Solution/0302-azure-cosmos-db-keys.png)

4. The `EmbeddingDeploymentName` value is preset, based on the deployment created by the Bicep script for the `text-embedding-ada-002` model. If that value differs in your environment, you must update this setting accordingly.

</details>

### 03: Test the function

Test the function locally and evaluate the inputs and outputs of the function.

1. Use breakpoints in the function's `Run` method to examine the input collection and processing as a new record is added.
2. After starting a local debug session, insert the following document into the `MaintenanceRequests` container and observe the function execution results as your breakpoints are hit.

   ```json
   {
     "hotel_id": 1, 
     "hotel": "Oceanview Inn",
     "source": "customer",
     "date": "2024-08-10",
     "details": "The air conditioning (A/C) unit in room 227 is malfunctioning and making a loud noise. Customer will be out of the room between 5:00 and 8:30 PM this evening. This needs immediate maintenance attention. If the issue cannot be resolved, we will need to move the customer to a new room.",
     "room_number": 227
   }
   ```

3. Once the function execution is complete, examine the document in Cosmos DB and inspect the vector embeddings inserted into the `request_vector` field of the document.
