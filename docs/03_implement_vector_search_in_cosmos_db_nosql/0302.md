# Task 02 - Create and store vector embeddings (45 minutes)

## Introduction

Vectors, also known as embeddings or vector embeddings, are mathematical representations of data in a high-dimensional space. Each dimension corresponds to a feature of the data in this space, and tens of thousands of dimensions might be used to represent sophisticated data. A vector's position in this space represents its characteristics. Words, phrases, or entire documents, as well as images, audio, and other types of data, can all be vectorized. An embedding is a data representation format that machine learning models and algorithms can efficiently utilize. The embedding is an information-dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating point numbers. Hence, the distance between two embeddings in the vector space correlates with the semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. Azure OpenAI provides several models for creating vector embeddings, and for this exercise, you will use the `text-embedding-ada-002` model.

You will use a vector database to store the generated embeddings. Vector databases are designed to store and manage vector embeddings. The vector database you will use is Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. It allows you to store vectors alongside traditional schema-free data within your documents, streamlining data management and significantly enhancing the efficiency of vector operations. Keeping all relevant data in a single logical unit simplifies your data architecture, making it easy to understand and manage.

## Description

You configured Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL as an integrated vector database in the prior task. In this task, you will use an Azure Function, Azure OpenAI, and the Azure Cosmos DB change feed to generate vector embeddings for property maintenance requests and save those into the `MaintenanceRequests` container in Cosmos DB.

You will conclude by uploading data supplied by the Contoso Suites staff into the `MaintenanceRequests` container you created in Cosmos DB and allowing the deployed function app to generate vectors for each record. The JSON data files provided by Contoso Suites contain maintenance requests for several hotels on their resorts. They offer an example of the types of data the company believes can benefit from the similarity search capabilities provided by Vector Search in Cosmos DB for NoSQL, so they would like you to incorporate this data into the proof of concept.

The key tasks are as follows:

1. Review the Azure Function code in the `CosmosChangeFeedVectorization.cs` file in the `src\ContosoSuitesVectorizationFunction` folder. The function:
   1. Is triggered whenever a document is inserted or updated in the `MaintenanceRequests` container using the Azure Cosmos DB change feed.
   2. Combines the contents of a maintenance request's `hotel` and `details` fields and vectorizes the resulting text using a `text-embedding-ada-002` model in Azure OpenAI.
   3. Writes generated vectors into the `request_embeddings` fields of the document and updates it in the `MaintenanceRequests` container.
   4. Marks the document as "Vectorized."
2. Create a `local.settings.json` file in the `src\ContosoSuitesVectorizationFunction` folder and populate it with the settings the function needs to run the function locally. Hint: the required values can be identified using the calls to `Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable` in the `CosmosChangeFeedVectorization.cs` file, as well as providing the Cosmos DB connection string required by the input and output bindings of the function.
3. Test the function locally and evaluate the inputs and outputs of the function.
   1. Use breakpoints in the function's `Run` method to examine the input collection and processing as a new record is added.
   2. After starting a local debug session, insert the following document into the `MaintenanceRequests` container and observe the function execution results as your breakpoints are hit.

      ```json
      {
        "hotel_id": 1, 
        "hotel": "Oceanview Inn",
        "source": "customer",
        "date": "2024-08-10",
        "details": "The air conditioning (A/C) unit in room 227 is malfunctioning and making a loud noise. Customer will be out of the room between 5:00 and 8:30 PM this evening. This needs immediate maintenance attention. If the issue cannot be resolved, we will need to move the customer to a new room.",
        "room_number": 227
      }
      ```

   3. Once the function execution is complete, examine the document in Cosmos DB and inspect the vector embeddings inserted into the `request_vector` field of the document.
4. Use VS Code to deploy the function to the Azure Function App in your resource group and add the required app configuration settings.
5. Verify that the deployed function is working correctly by inserting the following record into the `MaintenanceRequests` container in Cosmos DB. Then, use the Log Stream for the Function App to observe the output.

    ```json
    {
      "hotel_id": 12, 
      "hotel": "The Downtown Plaza Hotel",
      "source": "customer",
      "date": "2024-08-11",
      "details": "The thermostat does not appear to be working in room 328, and the air conditioning (A/C) unit will not turn on to cool down the room.",
      "room_number": 328
    }
    ```

6. Populate the `MaintenanceRequests` container with data from the `PropertyMaintenance.json` file in the [src\data folder](https://github.com/microsoft/TechExcel-Integrating-Azure-PaaS-and-AI-Services-for-AI-Design-Wins/tree/main/src/data) of the repository.
7. Observe the files being processed in the Log Stream and review documents in the Cosmos DB Data Explorer to confirm the function correctly populated the `request_vector` field for newly added documents.
8. Execute a query to find documents similar to "air conditioning malfunction" using the `VectorDistance()` function via Cosmos DB Data Explorer. You can find the vector embeddings for "air conditioning malfunction" in the `Query_Vector.txt` file in the [src\data folder](https://github.com/microsoft/TechExcel-Integrating-Azure-PaaS-and-AI-Services-for-AI-Design-Wins/tree/main/src/data).

## Solution

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Expand this section to view the solution</summary>

- The steps to review the function app are as follows:
  - Open the `CosmosChangeFeedVectorization.cs` file in the `src\ContosoSuitesVectorizationFunction` folder.
  - The `DatabaseName` and `ContainerName` constants defined on lines 16 and 17 refer to the Azure Cosmos DB database created by the Bicep script and the container you created in task 1 of this exercise, respectively. If those values differ in your environment, the values assigned to the constants must be updated to reflect what is in your environment.
  - Locate the `Run` function starting on line 42 and examine the code contained within it.
    - The code on line 49 reduces the list of documents sent to the function to only those that do not have a `Type` of "Vectorized". This prevents the updates pushed by the function back to the `MaintenanceRequests` container from being revectorized by the function.
    - If no documents require vectorization, the function will exit without making any changes to the input documents.
    - The `foreach` loop starting on line 52 iterates through each document in the change feed that requires vectorization. The `hotel` and `details` fields are combined, and the text is sent to Azure OpenAI to create vector embeddings using the deployment for the `text-embedding-ada-002` model. The returned vector embeddings are saved into the `RequestVector` field of the document.
    - The document's `Type` field is "Vectorized."
    - On line 74, the list of input documents is returned, which uses the Cosmos DB output binding to write the documents updated with vector embeddings back into the `MaintenanceRequests` container in Cosmos DB.

- To create a `local.settings.json` file, navigate to the `src\ContosoSuitesVectorizationFunction` directory, create a new file named `local.settings.json`, and add the following content, replacing the bracketed tokens with values from your Azure OpenAI and Azure Cosmos DB services.

    ```json
    {
      "IsEncrypted": false,
      "Values": {
        "AzureWebJobsStorage": "",
        "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet-isolated",
        "AzureOpenAIEndpoint": "[YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT]",
        "AzureOpenAIKey": "[YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_KEY]",
        "CosmosDBConnectionString": "[YOUR_COSMOS_DB_CONNECTION_STRING]",
        "EmbeddingDeploymentName": "text-embedding-ada-002"
      }
    }
    ```

  - To retrieve the required Azure OpenAI and Cosmos DB values, open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) in a web browser and navigate to the resource group you created.
  - Select the Azure OpenAI service in the resource group.
    - Under the **Resource Management** menu, select **Keys and Endpoint**.
    - Copy the value of **KEY 1** and paste it into the `AzureOpenAIKey` value of the `local.settings.json` file.
    - Copy the value of **Endpoint** and paste it into the `AzureOpenAIEndpoint` value.

      ![The Azure OpenAI Keys and Endpoint page is displayed, with the copy buttons for KEY 1 and Endpoint highlighted.](../../media/Solution/0302-azure-openai-keys-and-endpoint.png)

  - Return to your resource group and select the Azure Cosmos DB resource.
    - Under the **Settings** menu, select **Keys**, then show and copy the **PRIMARY CONNECTION STRING** value and paste it as the `CosmosDBConnectionString` value in the `local.settings.json` file.
  
      ![The Azure Cosmos DB account Keys page is displayed, with the PRIMARY CONNECTION STRING copy button highlighted.](../../media/Solution/0302-azure-cosmos-db-keys.png)

  - The `EmbeddingDeploymentName` value is preset, based on the deployment created by the Bicep script for the `text-embedding-ada-002` model. If that value differs in your environment, you must update this setting accordingly.

- To test the function locally:
  - Open a new terminal window in Visual Studio Code and change the path to the `src\ContosoSuitesVectorizationFunction` folder.
  - Open the `CosmosChangeFeedVectorization.cs` file in the `src\ContosoSuitesVectorizationFunction` folder.
  - Set a breakpoint on line 50 so you can examine the values of the `documentsToVectorize`, `task.RequestVector`, and `input` as you step through the function.
  - Select **F5** on your keyboard to start a debug session in Visual Studio Code. In the terminal window created, wait until the function has started.
  - In a browser window, open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigate to your Cosmos DB account.
  - On the Azure Cosmos DB account page, select **Data Explorer** from the left-hand menu, expand the **ContosoSuites** database and the **MaintenanceRequests** container, and select **Items** under the container.
  - Select **New item** on the toolbar, then paste the following document into the window that appears.

    ```json
    {
      "hotel_id": 1, 
      "hotel": "Oceanview Inn",
      "source": "customer",
      "date": "2024-08-10",
      "details": "The air conditioning (A/C) unit in room 227 is malfunctioning and making a loud noise. Customer will be out of the room between 5:00 and 8:30 PM this evening. This needs immediate maintenance attention. If the issue cannot be resolved, we will need to move the customer to a new room.",
      "room_number": 227
    }
    ```

  - Select **Save** on the toolbar to insert the document into the `MaintenanceRequests` container:
  - Return to Visual Studio Code and wait for your breakpoint to be hit.
  - Observe the values of the `documentsToVectorize`, `task.RequestVector`, and `input` variables as you step through the code (F11), allowing the function to run completely.
  - Return to the Cosmos DB **Data Explorer** in the Azure portal and select the document that was inserted into the `MaintenanceRequests` container. Inspect the `request_vector` property to review the structure of the generated vector embeddings. Also, note the `type` field has been set to "Vectorized."
  - Return to Visual Studio Code and select "Shift+F5" on the keyboard to stop the function app debug session.

- The steps to deploy the function to Azure are as follows:
  - In Visual Studio Code, open a new terminal window and change the directory to the `src\ContosoSuitesVectorizationFunction` project folder.
  - At the terminal prompt, execute the following command to build a release version of the function:

    ```bash
    dotnet build --configuration Release
    dotnet publish
    ```

  - In the explorer pane in Visual Studio Code, navigate to the `src\ContosoSuitesVectorizationFunction\bin\Release\net8.0` folder, then right-click on the `publish` folder, and in the context menu, select **Deploy to Function App**.
  - In the **Select Function App** command pallet dialog that appears at the top of Visual Studio Code:
    - Select the subscription you are using for this exercise.
    - Choose the function app in your resource group.
  - Select **Deploy** in the Visual Studio Code dialog asking about deploying and overwriting previous deployments.
  - Use the **Output** window at the bottom of Visual Studio Code to monitor the deployment.
  - When the deployment is complete, you will get a notification in the bottom right-hand corner of Visual Studio Code. In this notification window, select **Upload settings**. This will upload the values from the `local.settings.json` file into environment variables in your function app.

    ![The Upload settings button is highlighted on the deployment completed notification dialog.](../../media/Solution/0302-azure-function-deployment-upload-settings.png)

  - Confirm the settings were uploaded correctly by navigating to the **Settings** menu of your function app in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and selecting **Environment variables**. You should see the `AzureOpenAIEndpoint`, `AzureOpenAIKey`, `CosmosDBConnectionString`, and `EmbeddingDeploymentName` settings, along with other settings added by the Bicep script and deployment process.

    {: .note }
    > If you do not see these settings, add them using the App settings tab's **+ Add** button.

- To verify the function app was deployed successfully and is working correctly:
  - Open the Log Stream for the Function App by selecting **Log Stream** under **Monitoring** in the left-hand menu of the Function App page in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
  - Open a new browser window or tab, navigate to the `MaintenanceRequests` container in your Cosmos DB account, and select `Items`.
  - Insert the following record into the `MaintenanceRequests` container in Cosmos DB.

    ```json
    {
      "hotel_id": 12, 
      "hotel": "The Downtown Plaza Hotel",
      "source": "customer",
      "date": "2024-08-11",
      "details": "The thermostat does not appear to be working in room 328, and the air conditioning (A/C) unit will not turn on to cool down the room.",
      "room_number": 328
    }
    ```

  - Return to the Function Apps **Log Stream** browser window and observe the logs to ensure you see the function execute and verify that it generated vector embeddings for the maintenance request.
  - Return to the Cosmos DB `MaintenanceRequests` browser window and select the request item that was just inserted to ensure it refreshes and contains a `request_vector` value.

- Use the Data Explorer to populate the `MaintenanceRequests` container with data from the `PropertyMaintenance.json` file provided by Contoso Suites.
  - In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your Cosmos DB resource and select **Data Explorer** in the left-hand menu.
  - In the Data Explorer, expand the **ContosoSuites** database and the **MaintenanceRequests** container, then select **Items**.

    ![Data Explorer is highlighted in the left-hand menu. The expand icon is highlighted for the database and MaintenanceRequests containers. Items is highlighted.](../../media/Solution/0302-azure-cosmos-db-data-explorer-maintenance-requests-items.png)

    ```sql
    SELECT c.hotel_id, c.hotel, c.details, VectorDistance(c.request_vector, <QUERY_VECTOR>) AS SimilarityScore
    FROM c
    ```

  - Replace the `<QUERY_VECTOR>` token in the query with the vectorized representation of "air conditioning malfunction," which you can find in the `Query_Vector.txt` file in the [src\data folder](https://github.com/microsoft/TechExcel-Integrating-Azure-PaaS-and-AI-Services-for-AI-Design-Wins/tree/main/src/data). Copy the entire contents of the file, and paste it into the query in place of `<QUERY_VECTOR>`.
  - Select **Execute Query** on the toolbar and observe the output in the **Results** panel. You should see a list of results similar to the following (abbreviated for brevity):

    ```json
    {
        "hotel_id": 1,
        "hotel": "Oceanview Inn",
        "details": "The air conditioning (A/C) unit in room 227 is malfunctioning and making a loud noise. Customer will be out of the room between 5:00 and 8:30 PM this evening. This needs immediate maintenance attention. If the issue cannot be resolved, we will need to move the customer to a new room.",
        "SimilarityScore": 0.847799148429741
    },
    {
        "hotel_id": 12,
        "hotel": "The Downtown Plaza Hotel",
        "details": "The thermostat does not appear to be working in room 328, and the air conditioning (A/C) unit will not turn on to cool down the room.",
        "SimilarityScore": 0.838297398035295
    }
