# Task 03 - Implement vector search of audio transcriptions and summaries (30 minutes)

## Introduction

After seeing you generate a call transcript and summary in the prior tasks of this exercise, the Contoso Suites development team is excited at the prospect of saving these transcripts and then searching through them. They would like to use Cosmos DB to store the transcript and then perform semantic search--that is, searching by concepts or meanings rather than specific words. The primary benefit to semantic search is that requesters can retrieve documents based on the meaning of terms rather than exact term match. This will return documents that the requester might have intended but did not include any of the precise words that appeared in the request. Further, we will search on the abstractive summarization of the transcript, shortening the transcript to a segment of approximately two sentences. Searching the summaries rather than full texts will reduce the number of false positive results when using a vector comparison technique such as cosine similarity for search.

## Description

In this task, you will implement functionality to save the text of a call transcription, as well as its embedding (via Azure OpenAI), in a Cosmos DB container. You will then make use of Cosmos DB's vector similarity capability to perform semantic search in the existing Streamlit application.

## Success Criteria

- You are saving transcripts and abstractive summaries in Cosmos DB, as well as an embedding of the abstractive summary.
- You are able to perform a search on the **Call Center Search** page, returning call transcripts based on a text query.

## Key Tasks

### 01: Create call transcripts container

Create a new Cosmos DB container in the `ContosoSuites` database. Name this container `CallTranscripts`. It should have a partition key of `/call_id` and the same vector embedding policy that you used in Exercise 03: a container vector policy using the `cosine` distance function, based on a `float32` data type, and `1536` dimensions, using an index type of `diskANN`. Designate the field for storing vector data as `request_vector`.

Container vector policies and vector indexing policies must be defined at the time of container creation. In order to create a container, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your Cosmos DB resource.
2. Select **Data Explorer** in the left-hand menu.
3. On the **Data Explorer** page, select **New Container**
4. In the **New Container** dialog:
    1. Select **Use existing** under **Database id** and select the **ContosoSuites** database from the dropdown list.
    2. Enter `CallTranscripts` into the **Container id** box.
    3. Enter `/call_id` into the **Partition key** box.
    4. Expand the **Container Vectory Policy** section of the dialog, select **Add vector embedding**, and then enter the following values into the  specified fields:
       - Path: Enter **"/request_vector"**.
       - Data type: Select **float32**.
       - Distance function: Select **cosine**.
       - Dimensions: Enter **1536**. This is based on the number of dimensions generated by the `ada-text-embedding-002` model in Azure OpenAI.
       - Index type: Select **diskANN**. Given the number of dimensions being specified, 1536, the `flat` index type will not work, as it only  supports a maximum of 505 dimensions for vectors. The `quantizedFlat` index could also be used here. `diskANN` is a more efficient index type,  but given the amount of data we are working with in this lab, you likely will not notice any difference in performance.
    5. Select **OK** to create the container.

### 02: Make embedding request

Open the `4_Call_Center.py` file in the `ContosoSuitesDashboard` folder. Complete the function `make_azure_openai_embedding_request()`, accepting a string of text and creating an embedding based on it. Be sure to use the `embedding_deployment_name` secret, as the GPT-4o model deployment will not be appropriate for generating embeddings.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary>

The completed version of the `make_azure_openai_embedding_request()` function is as follows:

```python
def make_azure_openai_embedding_request(text):
    """Create and return a new embedding request. Key assumptions:
    - Azure OpenAI endpoint, key, and deployment name stored in Streamlit secrets."""

    token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(
        DefaultAzureCredential(), "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default"
    )
    aoai_endpoint = st.secrets["aoai"]["endpoint"]
    aoai_embedding_deployment_name = st.secrets["aoai"]["embedding_deployment_name"]

    client = openai.AzureOpenAI(
        azure_ad_token_provider=token_provider,
        api_version="2024-06-01",
        azure_endpoint = aoai_endpoint
    )
    # Create and return a new embedding request
    return client.embeddings.create(
        model=aoai_embedding_deployment_name,
        input=text
    )
```

If the code shows some errors on the `DefaultAzureCredential` or `get_bearer_token_provider` you may need to add this line at the top of the file:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider
```

</details>

### 03: Generate embeddings

Complete the function `generate_embeddings_for_call_contents()`. This function should normalize the incoming text before calling `make_azure_openai_embedding_request()`. Then, you should return the actual embeddings--not just the entire response object!.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary>

The completed version of the `generate_embeddings_for_call_contents()` function is as follows:

```python
def generate_embeddings_for_call_contents(call_contents):
    """Generate embeddings for call contents. Key assumptions:
    - Call contents is a single string.
    - Azure OpenAI endpoint, key, and deployment name stored in Streamlit secrets."""

    # Normalize the text for tokenization
    normalized_content = normalize_text(call_contents)

    # Call make_azure_openai_embedding_request() with the normalized content
    response = make_azure_openai_embedding_request(normalized_content)

    return response.data[0].embedding
```

</details>

### 04: Save transcript

Complete the function `save_transcript_to_cosmos_db()`. This function should create a new record in the `CallTranscripts` container.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary>

The completed version of the `save_transcript_to_cosmos_db()` function is as follows:

```python
def save_transcript_to_cosmos_db(transcript_item):
    """Save embeddings to Cosmos DB vector store. Key assumptions:
    - transcript_item is a JSON object containing call_id (int), 
        call_transcript (string), and request_vector (list).
    - Cosmos DB endpoint, client_id, and database name stored in Streamlit secrets."""

    cosmos_client_id = st.secrets["cosmos"]["client_id"]
    cosmos_credentials = DefaultAzureCredential(managed_identity_client_id=cosmos_client_id)

    cosmos_endpoint = st.secrets["cosmos"]["endpoint"]
    cosmos_database_name = st.secrets["cosmos"]["database_name"]
    cosmos_container_name = "CallTranscripts"

    # Create a CosmosClient
    client = CosmosClient(url=cosmos_endpoint, credential=cosmos_credentials)
    # Load the Cosmos database and container
    database = client.get_database_client(cosmos_database_name)
    container = database.get_container_client(cosmos_container_name)

    # Insert the call transcript
    container.create_item(body=transcript_item)
```

</details>

### 05: Update call center search page

Open the `5_Call_Center_search.py` file. Replace the `make_azure_openai_embedding_request()` stub function with the function you created in `4_Call_Center.py`. The function call will be exactly the same between these two files.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary>

The completed version of the `make_azure_openai_embedding_request()` function is as follows:

```python
def make_azure_openai_embedding_request(text):
    """Create and return a new embedding request. Key assumptions:
    - Azure OpenAI endpoint, key, and deployment name stored in Streamlit secrets."""

    token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(
        DefaultAzureCredential(), "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default"
    )
    aoai_endpoint = st.secrets["aoai"]["endpoint"]
    aoai_embedding_deployment_name = st.secrets["aoai"]["embedding_deployment_name"]

    client = openai.AzureOpenAI(
        azure_ad_token_provider=token_provider,
        api_version="2024-06-01",
        azure_endpoint = aoai_endpoint
    )
    # Create and return a new embedding request
    return client.embeddings.create(
        model=aoai_embedding_deployment_name,
        input=text
    )
```

</details>

### 06: Make Cosmos DB vector search request

Complete the `make_cosmos_db_vector_search_request()` function. It should perform a `VectorDistance()` query and return up to `max_results` results with a minimum similarity score of `minimum_similarity_score`. The columns it should return include `id`, `call_id`, `call_transcript`, `abstractive_summary`, and the results of `VectorDistance()` as `SimilarityScore`.

        parameters=[
            {"name": "@request_vector", "value": query_embedding}
        ],
        enable_cross_partition_query=True
    )

    # Create and return a new vector search request
    return results
```

</details>

### 07: Test and deploy

After filling in these code segments, re-run the application and navigate to the **Call Center** page. Ensure that you can still generate a transcript of the sample call audio. Then, run the function to save your transcript into Cosmos DB. After that, switch to the **Call Center Search** page and use the term "Airport Gateway hotel" for your search. Ensure that you get one result back. Then, increase the **Minimum Similarity Score** slider to a point higher than your similarity score and ensure you get zero records back.

Then, deploy the application and ensure that the functionality behaves as expected as an App Service.
