# Task 02 - Query data from Azure AI Search (20 minutes)

## Introduction

The ChatGPT series of models available in Azure OpenAI has been trained on a wide variety of datasets online, but these datasets tend to be publicly available. For private and proprietary datasets, we will need a different approach than to expect ChatGPT has the available information. In this second task of the exercise, we will push data into an Azure storage account and convert it into an Azure AI Search index.

Before our GPT-4 model can reference our proprietary datasets, we first need to **vectorize** the data--that is, convert data inputs into a collection of floating-point numbers. We can store these vectorized results (also known as **embeddings**) in a variety of data stores. In this exercise, we will use Azure AI Search. Azure AI Search allows us to store not only the embeddings but also the raw text data. This will allow us to perform hybrid lookup operations--that is, keyword search against the raw text as well as vector search against the embeddings.

## Description

In this task, you will load data that Contoso Suites staff has provided to you into Azure Blob Storage. This data contains a summary, in JSON format, of several of their resort properties and hotels located on the resorts. This is an example of the type of data the company would like to use to enhance chat results, so they would like you to incorporate this data into the Azure OpenAI proof of concept. You may find these files in [the src/data folder](https://github.com/microsoft/TechExcel-Integrating-Azure-PaaS-and-AI-Services-for-AI-Design-Wins/tree/main/src/data) for the repository.

## Success Criteria

- You have created an Azure Blob Storage container and uploaded the Resorts and Hotels data files.
- You are able to view the files in Azure Blob Storage.
- You have executed code to generate a new Azure AI Search index.
- Your front-end application can handle chat against the `contoso-suites-faq` index.

## Key Tasks

### 01: Import files into storage account

Import the data from **Resorts.txt**, **Hotels.txt**, and **FAQ.txt** into a container named `contoso-suites`.

Make sure you use the storage account you created in exercise 1, as the storage account must be in the same region as Azure AI Search.

One approach to this is as follows:

1. Navigate to the storage account in [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Select the **Containers** option from the **Data storage** menu.
3. Create a new container using the **+ Container** option. Name the container `contoso-suites`.
4. Inside the "contoso-suites" container, select the **Upload** option and choose each text file.
5. The files do not need to be in separate folders in the blob storage container.

Alternatively, you may right-click on each file in Visual Studio Code and select **Upload to Azure Storage...** This is functionality that the Azure Storage extension in Visual Studio Code offers. From there, choose the appropriate storage account and the `contoso-suites` container. If you have not already created the `contoso-suites` container, you will need to do so before uploading the first file. Ensure that the files do get uploaded into the storage account before continuing.

### 02: Build an Azure AI Search index

Create a `contoso-suites-faq` index in Azure AI Search, built on the three files in the `contoso-suites` container in your storage account. You should embed with `text-embedding-002-ada` and support Hybrid (Vector + Keyword) search.

<details markdown="block">

1. In [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the resource group you have created and select the **Search service** in the resource group.
2. Navigate to the **Overview** menu option in the Search service. Then, select the **Import and vectorize data** menu option.

    ![Select the Import and vectorize data menu option.](../../media/Solution/0102_ImportVectorizeData.png)

3. Select **Azure Blob Storage** as the data connection type.
4. In the **Configure your Azure Blob Storage** form, select your subscription, the storage account for this training, and the `contoso-suites` blob container. Select the checkbox to authenticate using managed identity. Choose User-assigned from the drop-down and select the User-assigned managed identity that was created in your resource group.
Then select **Next**.

    ![Configure your Azure Blob Storage account.](../../media/Solution/0102_ConfigureBlobStorage.png)

5. In the **Vectorize your text** form, ensure that the kind of service is **Azure OpenAI** and choose the Azure OpenAI service associated with your resource group. After that, pick **text-embedding-ada-002** as the model deployment. Select authentication type **User assigned identity** and choose your user-assigned managed identity. Check the box acknowledging that connecting to an Azure OpenAI service will incur additional costs and then select **Next** to continue.

    ![Select your Azure OpenAI service and the text-embedding-ada-002 model deployment.](../../media/Solution/0102_VectorizeText.png)

6. On the **Vectorize and enrich your images** page, select **Next** without checking any boxes.
7. On the **Advanced settings** page, select **Next** without changing any settings.
8. On the **Review and create** page, enter `contoso-suites-faq` as your object names prefix and then select **Create**.

    ![Add contoso-suites-faq as the object name prefix and create the index.](../../media/Solution/0102_ReviewAndCreate.png)

9.  You can navigate to the **Indexers** page in **Search management**. Within a minute or two, you should see a **Success** status and three documents succeeded.

    ![The Indexers menu option shows that index preparation was successful.](../../media/Solution/0102_Indexers.png)

10. Then, navigate to the **Indexes** menu option. It may take several minutes for the index to populate, but you should eventually see results.

### 03: Enable chat against FAQ data

Update the front-end code in `src/ContosoSuitesDashboard/` to enable chat operations against the FAQ index.

1. Create a file called `secrets.toml` in `src/ContosoSuitesDashboard/.streamlit/`. Pattern it after `secrets.template.toml` but include your Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search, Azure AI Services Speech service, Azure AI Services Language service, Web API endpoint, and Cosmos DB details.
2. The Contoso Suites team has followed instructions online on how to interact with an Azure OpenAI model deployment. They would like you to extend the code in `src/ContosoSuitesDashboard/pages/1_Chat_with_Data.py` to ensure any queries make use of the Azure AI Search index you have created rather than relying on the inbuilt knowledge of the default GPT-4 model.
3. You can test your work by running the following queries. The first two queries should respond with relevant information. The final two queries should not give you a valid response because they ask for information outside the scope of our data.
   1. Which hotels on the island of Curacao have EV stations?
   2. Do I need to pay extra money to use an EV station when I am a guest of the hotel?
   3. How tall is the highest mountain peak in the Alps?
   4. What is the current political situation in Thailand?

1. Create a file called `secrets.toml` in `src/ContosoSuitesDashboard/.streamlit/`. Copy the contents of `secrets.template.toml` as a starting point. Then, fill in the details from the Azure services you deployed.
   1. For Azure OpenAI secrets:
      1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), find the resource group you created.
      2. Navigate to the Azure OpenAI service in your resource group.
      3. In the **Resource Management** menu, select the **Keys and Endpoint** entry. Copy the value of **KEY 1** and save it as `key` in the `[aoai]` section of your secrets file. Copy the value of **Endpoint** and save it as `endpoint`.
   2. For Azure AI Search service secrets:
      1. Return to the resource group and then select your Azure AI Search service.
      2. Copy the value of **Url** from the **Essentials** panel and save it as `endpoint` in the `[search]` section of your secrets file.

          ![Select the Azure AI Search service URL and save it to the Secrets file.](../../media/Solution/0102_SearchEndpoint.png)

      3. In the **Settings** menu, select the **Keys** entry. Copy the value of **Primary admin key** and save it as `key` in the `[search]` section of your secrets file.
   3. For Azure AI Speech service secrets:
      1. Return to the resource group and select your Speech service.
      2. In the **Resource Management** menu, select the **Keys and Endpoint** entry. Copy the value of **KEY 1** and save it as `key` in the `[speech]` section of your secrets file. Copy the value of **Location/Region** and save it as `region`.
   4. For Azure AI Language service secrets:
      1. Return to the resource group and select your Language service.
      2. In the **Resource Management** menu, select the **Keys and Endpoint** entry. Copy the value of **KEY 1** and save it as `key` in the `[language]` section of your secrets file. Copy the value of **Endpoint** and save it as `endpoint`.
   5. For API secrets:
      1. For now, set the value of **endpoint** to `http://localhost:5292`. In Exercise 2, when you run the Web API code locally, you will see the URL it uses for hosting. If the hosting port differs from 5292, change your secret to match that hosting port.
      2. Return to the resource group and select the App Service named `{your_unique_id}-api`.
      3. Copy the value of **Default domain** and save it for later (and include `https://` if it is not there when you copy the value). You will need to change the value of `[api][endpoint]` to this URL when you deploy the Streamlit application to Azure App Services, so you will need this URL in the next task.
   6. For Cosmos DB secrets:
      1. Return to the resource group and select the Azure Cosmos DB account.
      2. In the **Settings** menu, navigate to the **Keys** option. Copy the value of **URI** and save it as `endpoint` in the `[cosmos]` section of your secrets file.
      3. Find and copy the **ClientId** of the User-Assigned Managed Identity in your resource group. Paste it as the `client_id` value in the `[cosmos]` file

2. Open the file `src/ContosoSuitesDashboard/pages/1_Chat_with_Data.py`. The code will run as-is, but will not have knowledge of your search index. To support chat with data, make the following changes to the Python script.
   1. Add the search secrets to the `create_chat_completion()` function, below the Azure OpenAI secrets and above the call to create a client.

        ```python
        search_endpoint = st.secrets["search"]["endpoint"]
            search_key = st.secrets["search"]["key"]
            search_index_name = st.secrets["search"]["index_name"]
        ```

        {: .important }
        > Python is a whitespace-significant language, so you will need to ensure that any code you add is appropriately indented. If you are not familiar with whitespace rules in Python, the **Python** extension for Visual Studio Code will help track whitespace-related errors.

   2. You may also wish to update the docstring for `create_chat_completion()` to reference this new assumption.
   3. Change the `create_chat_completion()` function's `return` statement's chat completion request to one that includes an Azure AI Search data source.

        ```python
        return client.chat.completions.create(
                model=aoai_deployment_name,
                messages=[
                    {"role": m["role"], "content": m["content"]}
                    for m in messages
                ],
                stream=True,
                extra_body={
                    "data_sources": [
                        {
                            "type": "azure_search",
                            "parameters": {
                                "endpoint": search_endpoint,
                                "index_name": search_index_name,
                                "authentication": {
                                    "type": "api_key",
                                    "key": search_key
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            )
        ```

3. In order to test your code, navigate to the `src/ContosoSuitesDashboard/` folder in your terminal. Then, run the following command to begin the Streamlit dashboard.

    ```python
    python -m streamlit run Index.py
    ```
